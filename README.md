	Our models

	/*
		Now all of these are technically "user" models.
		What sets them apart is accountType. Profiles vary based on this.
		Also, filepicker is an external service that handles file uploads.
		Makes it super easy for users to upload their own pictures.
		We can also go the gravatar route which is nice.

		I'm not too sure on how we'll model schools.
		Recruiters and students are similar enough. 
		Schools, I'm not too sure on what we're looking for.
		So I'll hold off until we can talk again.
		Schools could look like the company model.
		What will we call users who sign up to manage the schools?
